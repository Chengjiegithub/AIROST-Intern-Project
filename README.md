By using the app with bluetooth connection, we can create a control panel to control the robot.

4 directional key could control the movement of the robot. The red button at the middle act as an emergency stop to prevent accident happen.
For the slider at the right, each will control the 2 servo motors that use to control the robot arm.


# Autonomous Mode 
For the autonomous mode, it will be activated by pressing the switch on the robot to change between autonomous mode and manual mode. 
IR sensor and Ultrasonic sensor will provide the information on the road for the robot to make the robot able to differentiate obstacle and pickable objects.
